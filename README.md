The program's input is to be read from the standard input (i.e., std::cin). It is separated into four sections: 
A description of a course's graded artifacts, defining both a number of points possible and a relative weight for each. 
A description of the students in the course, listing a student ID, a grade option, and a name for each. 
A list of the raw scores received on each graded artifact by students in the course. 
A list of cutpoint sets, describing the total score required to receive an A, B, C, or D, respectively. (This project assumes that there are no +/- modifiers on grades, and that there are no other kinds of grades such as Incomplete, though we will support Pass/NotPass grades; see below.)
